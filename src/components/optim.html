                    **Wakanda Forever was an earnest film that tackled some
                    tough themes and honored its hero well but got bogged down
                    introducing vast new worlds and complicated characters.**
                    Wakanda Forever left me with mixed emotions. The respect and
                    love paid to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman were heartfelt,
                    meaningful, and sincere. The movie wisely grappled with the
                    aftermath of T’Challa’s passing on his family and nation.
                    This subject matter created excellent opportunities to dive
                    deeper into characters like Shuri, Nakia, and even M’Baku.
                    Instead, Wakanda Forever primarily served as a vehicle to
                    introduce Namor and Talokan. The film rightfully embraced a
                    more somber tone as it dealt with themes of loss and legacy,
                    but the mournful spirit caused the plot to sag and drag
                    along throughout most of the runtime. Winston Duke offers
                    the little levity the movie had. The cast delivered
                    exceptionally, with Angela Bassett’s performance as the true
                    standout. I liked the movie, but the melancholy approach
                    made it more difficult to really enjoy, and the introduction
                    of Namor and his threat to Wakanda chewed up so much of the
                    story that it was difficult to bring closure to characters
                    struggling with loss and heartbreak satisfyingly.

                    "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever may not quite measure up to
                    its predecessor, but it leaves a proud, beautiful, silent
                    tribute to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman, telling an
                    emotionally powerful, resonant story about how grief can
                    truly be love persevering. The screenplay runs into problems
                    when it deviates from the central theme and tries to mix in
                    other MCU stories/characters, with Namor and Riri suffering
                    collateral damage. Technically, the action set pieces are
                    mostly riveting, despite some inconsistent VFX and lighting.
                    Score and sound production stand out in a remarkably
                    memorable manner. Brutally passionate, moving performances,
                    especially from Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, and Danai
                    Gurira. Exquisite pacing reduces the weight of the long
                    runtime. Totally worth the emotional investment." Rating: B+

                    Mourning the unexplained death of King "T'Challa", the
                    tech-rich African nation of "Wakanda" returns Queen
                    "Ramonda" (Angela Bassett) to the throne and she must
                    stabilise the kingdom and try to help her daughter "Shuri"
                    (Letitia Wright) deal with the loss of her much-loved
                    brother. A fireside chat late one night doesn't quite go to
                    plan though, when they are introduced to an interloper.
                    "Namor" (Tenoch Huerta) arrives to ask their help to thwart
                    the Americans who nave managed to design a machine that can
                    trace vibranium, and this has put his hitherto unknown
                    population of underwater, Mesoamerican, people at risk.
                    Either they help him to track down the scientist who created
                    this or there could be war. The Princess and her general
                    head to Massachusetts where they track down a college
                    student who is almost as much of a whizz-kid as "Shuri". The
                    FBI are on soon their trail and skedaddle they must,
                    straight into the arms of the waiting "Talokan" who take
                    them to their beautiful watery homeland where we learn just
                    how they evolved. Somewhat narked, the Queen wants her
                    daughter back and that action sows the seeds for a conflict
                    between the two nations that, well, you can guess the rest.
                    Sadly, that's the problem here. Despite a really strong and
                    vibrant performance from Wright and some very fine
                    production values, there is precious little story here. It
                    is far, far, too long to sustain the thin plot and the
                    conflict engineered between the two races is flawed in more
                    ways than an US Congressional election. The pace is really
                    slow, the combat scenes could have been choreographed by Sir
                    Matthew Bourne - or by a Wakandan cheerleader at their
                    equivalent of the "Superbowl" - and the supporting
                    characters aren't on screen long enough to give Miss Wright
                    enough help to wade through the frequent tedium. I wasn't
                    helped by Huerta's very thick accent which made his dialogue
                    nigh-on impossible to comprehend at times and the denouement
                    screamed sequel so loudly that I forgot that I'd long given
                    up on any jeopardy at the end two hours ago. There is a bit
                    of character tragedy, character loyalty and thankfully
                    Martin Freeman's ("Ross" - why does he need an American
                    accent?) appears but sparingly as we go along but Marvel
                    must stop taking the audience for granted. They have to
                    realise that their gorgeous Avatar-esque visual effects and
                    technical wizardry are not going to entertain us
                    indefinitely if the stories continue to deliver so weakly.
                    Great to look at, a few power-ballads from the soundtrack
                    and Wright is certainly a stylish and classy star -
                    otherwise, this is a film nobody will remember in two years
                    time, I'll bet!

                    _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_ had an impossible task in
                    the wake of the tragic passing of lead Chadwick Boseman, and
                    for the most part Ryan Coggler does a great job at picking
                    up the pieces and creating a heartfelt story. I feel as
                    though this movie is attempting to do too much though. There
                    are so many side plots and new characters being introduced
                    that the film has a hard time finding its footing. For as
                    much as I enjoyed Riri Williams and here banter with
                    Wakadans, her arch was not necessary. By omitting this
                    character, the story could have been more focused and
                    streamlined creating an easier viewing experience and
                    deflating the runtime. The writing was decent, but it was
                    pretty exposition heavy. There were countless number of
                    lines that were strictly feeding information to the
                    audience, and they felt inorganic and awkward in the moment.
                    These writing mishaps really hurt my enjoyment and
                    constantly pulled me out of the film. After those main
                    criticisms, I think this movie overall does a great job in
                    all other departments. The action is surprisingly light, but
                    when it does come it is intense and well-choreographed.
                    There are some really unique fight sequences and weapons
                    introduced with the "Atlanteans" that allowed for some
                    really cool scenes and visuals that were done with some
                    stellar CGI. I specifically like how the final battle had
                    some letterboxing that was not present in the rest of the
                    film. It gave it a grand scale that I thought was excellent
                    touch. The performances were fantastic all around. Angela
                    Bassett was mesmerizing and really captivated me with her
                    emotion and distress with the passing of her son. There is a
                    scene in here that gave me literal goosebumps. Dominique
                    Thorne was a great addition as Iron-Heart and Lupita Nyong'o
                    was amazing in her limited screen time. I loved Winston Duke
                    and desperately wanted more screentime from him. He was
                    sidelined for the majority of the film, and I think that was
                    the wrong decision. Letitia Wright is the real highlight
                    here. She stepped into a very difficult situation and acted
                    her ass off. I never envisioned her as a lead actress, but
                    she proved me wrong. Something I want to note that I do not
                    normally include in my reviews in the music choice. The
                    score to this movie was crafted brilliantly and really
                    elevate so many scenes. I enjoyed every song and feel as
                    though it blended with the movie brilliantly. Overall, this
                    movie has its drawbacks but is still an enjoyable watch and
                    one of the better movies in Marvel Phase IV. **Score:**
                    _75%_ | **Verdict:** _Good_

                    This was such a fun movie to watch. It was long but didn't
                    feel longer than a regular movie. There was a lot of action,
                    but also excellent character exposition. I don't want to
                    give anything away, but I loved the novel perspective on
                    leadership this one evolved to. Also the contrast between
                    how different Black Panthers inhabit that role and the
                    implications of that. I loved the new world discovered, with
                    its own mythology, and the way those two worlds can come
                    together, for good or ill. I can't wait to see where the
                    story goes next. Beautiful scenes and a fun story with great
                    characters. And the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, his
                    character, and the actor, were deeply moving and tastefully
                    done. Great soundtrack too. strong text

                    Chadwick Boseman is undeniably missed, but &lt;em&gt;'Black
                    Panther: Wakanda Forever'&lt;/em&gt; still manages to
                    produce an entertaining and even touching final chapter of
                    the MCU's Phase Four. I had a positive time with this, one
                    good thing about watching it almost two months after release
                    is that I got to watch this in an empty cinema - absolute
                    bliss. Thankfully I managed to avoid all spoilers, though
                    had heard the name Namor bandied about online so that's all
                    I knew coming into it. Speaking of Namor, I'm a fan. He
                    makes for a cool new character to the universe, as does
                    Talokan as a whole, with Tenoch Huerta a welcomed addition
                    to the cast - first time I recall seeing him in something,
                    and I'm impressed. The star of this 2022 flick, however, is
                    Letitia Wright. I don't really remember her standing out in
                    the original much, at least to me, but here Wright is
                    excellent. Angela Bassett is very good also, there's one
                    emotion-filled speech scene in particular that stands out in
                    my memory. Danai Gurira is always a joy to watch, while
                    Winston Duke and Lupita Nyong'o are the best of the rest -
                    though, the whole cast are good; even Martin Freeman, who
                    I'm not always convinced by. The film handles Boseman's
                    absence nicely, there are some very touching moments in
                    there. I'd say they went the correct way with the character
                    of T'Challa, no-one would've been able to even closely
                    replicate Boseman. The music, meanwhile, is pleasant. I do
                    think this has some relatively minor pacing issues, mainly
                    around the midway point, but other than that I felt more
                    than satisified with what I had just watched when leaving
                    the cinema. Phase Five, see you soon!
